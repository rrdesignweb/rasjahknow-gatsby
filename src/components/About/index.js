        Ras Jahknow blazes new soul and fresh rhythms into what is described
        best as culturally rich, roots reggae music. Passionate vocals in
        English and Creole weave through the diverse native sounds from the
        African island nation of Cape Verde, Brazil, Tanzania and Mauritius to
        Australia. The band embodies a vision of unity, respect and peace, built
        on the foundation of irresistible, reggae rhythms.
